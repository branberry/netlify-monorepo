Relational Migrator can attempt to recover continuous (CDC) sync jobs 
that have failed within the preceding 24-hour period. 
The procedure for recovering a CDC sync job differs, 
depending on whether you're using the embedded or Kafka deployment 
mode. For details on each job type, see :ref:`rm-sync-jobs`.

About this Task
---------------

- CDC sync job recovery depends on the type of deployment 
  mode your using. The following table summarizes the modes.

  .. list-table::
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Mode
       - Description

     * - Embedded Mode
       - Sync jobs that are running on a :ref:`local machine <local-machine-install>` or 
         a :ref:`unattended server <unattended-server>`.

     * - Kafka Mode
       - Sync jobs that are running with :ref:`Kafka support <kafka-intro>`.

- Examples of embedded mode recoverable scenarios include:
  
  - Unexpected application failure
  - Operating system restarts

- Examples of Kafka CDC sync job recoverable scenarios include:
  
  - Loss of individual `brokers <https://developer.confluent.io/courses/apache-kafka/brokers/>`__ in Kafka cluster
  - Application-level issues resulting in failed health checks

Task

Click the tab to display the recovery procedure 
for each deployment mode.

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Embedded Mode
      :tabid: embedded-mode

      For embedded mode recovery, the process to restart
      a sync job is manually triggered. This process requires 
      restarting the Relational Migrator application.

      .. procedure::

         .. step:: Navigate to the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab

         .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Resume` on the failed sync job 

   .. tab:: Kafka Mode
      :tabid: kafka-mode

      For the Kafka deployment mode recovery, the process to recover
      a sync job is automatic. Kafka health checks automatically 
      attempt to resume CDC sync jobs after a failure of 
      individual `Kafka brokers <https://developer.confluent.io/courses/apache-kafka/brokers/>`__
      for up to 24 hours.
